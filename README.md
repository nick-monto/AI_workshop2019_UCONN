# AI_workshop2019_UCONN
The included jupyter notebook was presented as a case study during an AI workshop that I hosted at the University of Connecticut in April 2019.

The presented material has a focus on identifying similarities and differences in the distributional information present in two online text corpora, the [SWDA corpus](https://github.com/cgpotts/swda) and a sample of the WSJ corpus. Following a purusal of the two datasets, we build a model that attempts to predict the dialog speech act associated with the given utterance.

The required packages are:

- gitpython
- tensorflow
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- scipy
- nltk
- sklearn

The code has been tested on Python 3.6.
